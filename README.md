The Net Ninja changes the rules in the Database tab on his Firestore database. He makes a new set of rules just for the users database in order to prevent random users from tampering with the database. One rule allows the user to create a document in the users database only if a user is logged in. This is necessary when a user first creates an account.
```
    match /users/{userID} {
      allow create: if request.auth.uid != null;
    }
```
Another rule allows a user to read a document in this database only if the i.d. of the document is the same as the user i.d.
```
    match /users/{userID} {
      allow create: if request.auth.uid != null;
      allow read: if request.auth.uid == userID;
    }
```
